  # About Symmetry
  
  - Now the symmetry is implemented by (A is a tensor with symmetry):
  
     1. D[A_(a,b), A_(c,d)] = 0     if (a,b) & (c,d) in different equivalent classes
     
                            = 1/n   if (a,b) & (c,d) in the same equivalent class S, and
                                    n is the |S|.
     
     2. D[ B[A], A ] = Derivative [no_symmetry_information] [B] [A] : D[A,A]
     
  - Better to store symmetry information in Derivative when A is simple:
  
        Derivative [(a,b)] [B] [A]
